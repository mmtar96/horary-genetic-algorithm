The objective of the algorithm is to generate two perfect schedules so that it is possible for teachers to teach all classes and for students to attend all classes. 
For this purpose, the following algorithm is implemented based on the theory of evolution in which, starting from a totally random solution, we will obtain the 
desired result.

It must be said that the algorithm does not end up converging in all cases, but the solution obtained is quite close to the desired one. 

It is a basic algorithm without much margin of execution since it is implemented in a very vertical way, but I believe that the power of this type of tools can be observed.

Can you apply this kind of algorithms in differents problem to get a solucion easier.
